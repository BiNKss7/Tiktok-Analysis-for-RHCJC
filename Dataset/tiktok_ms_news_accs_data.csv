"Bryan Bailey, the Mississippi sheriff whose department had been under federal investigation for torturing people, staffed his mother’s commercial chicken farm with inmates from the county jail and used taxpayer-purchased equipment to improve the grounds, according to four former inmates and a former deputy who said they had worked on the farm.

They said inmates with special privileges, known as trusties, were repeatedly driven to the farm south of Puckett — sometimes by Sheriff Bailey himself — to perform various tasks on top of their daily work duties for Rankin County.

Former trusties and others who worked on Sheriff Bailey’s family farm said inmates had received cash or meals in exchange for the work. The former deputy, Christian Dedmon, who is currently serving a federal prison sentence, said he had worked on the farm while he was on the clock at the sheriff’s department.

Hours after the publication of this investigation on Thursday, the attorney representing the Rankin County Sheriff’s Department, Jason Dare, issued a statement to some local news outlets conceding that Bailey used trusties to work on his farm and explaining that chicken supplies the department had purchased using county funds were for chickens kept on jail grounds for inmates’ benefit. The statement stopped short of directly denying some other allegations in the investigation, including that Bailey and others used a $97,000 construction vehicle bought in 2019 with department funds to clear land on the farm.

"Mississippi schools and the state education system are set to lose over $137 million in federal funds after the U.S. Department of Education halted access to pandemic-era grant money.

The abrupt loss of funds sent Mississippi public and private school leaders rushing to brace for the impact of wide ranging cuts. Some were already forced to fire grant-funded teachers, coaches and nurses.

At St. Richard Catholic School in Jackson, Father Joe Tonos and Principal Russ Nelson said the school would lose approximately $1.5 million, funds that pay staff salaries and fund programs for mental health. All schools staffers who were employed through grants were to be fired.

“This funding was not just a budgetary line item; it was a transformational support system for our school,” Nelson wrote in a memo reviewed by Mississippi Today. “Without it, we are facing difficult decisions and significant setbacks in our mission to provide a high-quality, supportive education for every student.”

"Fannie Lou Hamer was ""sick and tired of being sick and tired"" and helped launch a political movement that lasted longer than the Confederacy.

The Mississippi Democratic Freedom Party - founded in April 1964 - lasted until August of 1968. That’s a span of four years and four months - one month more than the Confederacy.

And its entire existence was rooted in challenging many of the residual aftershocks of the Confederacy.

On this final day of Confederate Heritage Month, let all of Mississippi ask of itself, which of these two legacies mocks the ideals of democracy, and which seeks to preserve them? 

And which should we care more about?

"A Rankin County supervisor called the victims tortured by Goon Squad officers ‘dopers’ and rapists.

Two days after the announcement of $2.5 million settlement, Rankin County Supervisor Steve Gaines said the department’s attorney, Jason Dare, “beat the pants off of those guys — the dopers, the people that raped and doped your daughters. He beat their pants off.”

Gaines was referring to Eddie Parker and his friend, Michael Jenkins, who were beaten, tased and sexually assaulted by the deputies before they shot Jenkins in the mouth during a mock execution. The deputies tried to plant a BB gun and drugs on the men to cover up their crimes, but they were ultimately convicted and sent to federal prison for decades.

Parker has one felony conviction in Rankin County for failing to “stop vehicle pursuant to officer’s signal,” according to court records. In Alabama, he had a 2019 conviction for drug possession with intent to distribute. Jenkins has no felony convictions listed in Rankin County. Neither has a conviction in neighboring Hinds County.

Gaines declined to comment about his remarks.

"As Biloxi investigators are still looking for the person responsible for opening fire at the club Elevate, city records show that the night club's business license is no longer active.
 
WLOX News obtained a copy of Elevate's business records with the City of Biloxi. According to the document, the club's license was listed inactive three days after the shooting.
 
Elevate's owners lease the building, so when the building owner told the city that the lease was not renewed, it prompted the city to list the business's license status as inactive.

"On Wednesday, the Mississippi Aquarium and members of Rehab Heroes celebrated the release of 19 endangered Kemp's ridley sea turtles.
 
The turtles recovered from a myriad of health issues sustained after they were stranded in the cold waters off the coast of Boston late last year.

""They've overcome pneumonia, bone infections, and trouble with digestion and frostbite. Now they're ready to go,"" said Dr. Alexa Delaune, Vice President of Veterinarian Services & Research at Mississippi Aquarium.

Populations of the nesting turtles were in the tens of thousands during the 1950s, but the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration claims those numbers dwindled to fewer than 250 nesting females in the mid-80s.

Dr. Delaune says the efforts of Rehab Heroes are critical to the conservation of this still-endangered species.

On Tuesday, Rubin Weeks, 63, was arrested for the abduction and murder of May.

May was a 17-year-old senior at Leake Academy when she disappeared after her shift at McDonald’s in the year 1986.

Nearly three weeks later, on what would have been May’s 18th birthday, her bound, nude body was discovered by an off-duty firefighter in Hinds County.

An autopsy later showed that she had been sexually assaulted.

The mystery surrounding her death has haunted and perplexed investigators for years.

Yet, nearly 40 years later, authorities appeared to be making breaks in the case.

Last year, Scott County Sheriff Mike Lee told WLBT News that “this is the closest investigators have ever been to solving the case.”

A group of retired investigators, also interviewed by WLBT News, were resolved to solving the case, working with the Mississippi Bureau of Investigation and others to re-examine the evidence and interviewing past witnesses.

On Tuesday, April 29, officers in Tupelo conducted a welfare check at a home inside The Villages subdivision.

Once there, they found Sherri Lazore, 62, dead.

Officers found their suspect at the home as well, identified as Joshua Lazore, 30. They arrested him and charged him with first-degree murder.

The coroner said Sherri Lazore was severely beaten and found in an outside garbage can.
A judge denied Joshua Lazore a bond during a hearing on Wednesday afternoon and said he is a danger to the community.

Police said Lazore confessed to the crime, and investigators found video evidence.
City prosecutor Richard Babb described it as a “particularly vicious crime.”

Sherri Lazore worked for the Tupelo Public School District for 27 years and retired in 2012.

“She was a great teacher who people loved and adored,” TPSD Director of Marketing and Communications Gregg Ellis stated. “It’s a huge loss for Tupelo Public Schools and the Tupelo community.”

Authorities previously arrested Joshua Lazore in 2020 after he entered the lobby of the Lee County Sheriff’s Department and damaged a computer, two TVs and a touch-screen kiosk.

The sheriff’s department charged him with felony destruction of public property.

"The Mississippi Board of Education approved getting rid of the administration and graduation requirement from the U.S. History test, beginning with this upcoming school year.

This happened during their regularly scheduled meeting on Thursday.

“Though the U.S. History statewide assessment will be eliminated starting next school year, it’s important to emphasize that students will still learn U.S. History and will be required to successfully complete the course to graduate,” said Dr. Lance Evans, state superintendent of education. “Having fewer state tests required to graduate should be less taxing on educators, students, and families alike.”

MDE did say, however, that all students will still be required to take and pass the high school U.S. History course to qualify for graduation.

State assessments in Algebra I, Biology, and English Language Arts will continue to be administered and remain a graduation requirement.

"The gospel music world is mourning the passing of a Mississippi Mass Choir legend. Mosie “Mama” Burks has died.

She spent her life praising God through music before audiences from the Magnolia state to South Africa, Italy, Japan, and beyond.

“I never felt qualified,” said Mosie Burks in February 2017.

Known as “Mama” Burks, the former lead soloist of the Mississippi Mass Choir’s gospel hits, did not feel worthy of leading songs that touched people around the world.

“Hilariously, Mama Burks resisted, and the reason she resisted joining she didn’t think she was good enough. We laughed about that for years,” said Mississippi Mass Choir Executive Director Jerry Mannery.

Born in Forest June 17, 1933, she picked cotton as a child before working as a domestic, moving to Jackson to pursue her education. 

Like most gospel greats, her roots were in the church, but she did not begin singing with the Mass Choir until 1996 as an alto section. She sang lead on “This Morning When I Rose” for the first time just weeks before the Malaco recording session.

“When Mama Burks walked out on that stage and she did the first signature shake of her hair and her head and her hair, the whole atmosphere shook,” said Mannery.

She traveled with the choir to at least eight countries, spreading the message of Christ. The MS Mass Choir founding member and executive director said the gospel legend will be remembered for her humility, strong faith in God, and soul-stirring performances like those at the Stellar Music Awards.

“We performed live ‘I’m Not Tired Yet.’ Aretha Franklin in the front row, Reverend Jesse Jackson, all these folks in the front row,” said Mannery. “When the song went off, the audience wouldn’t stop singing it.”

That song Malaco Records licensed to ESPN for the Scott Van Pelt Show. The songstress retired in 2020, last performing during the Mass Choir’s 50th Anniversary.

“She did not really realize how great the impact she had on the gospel music industry,” added Mannery.
The wife and mother of three was 92.

"Chaos erupted on Wednesday in what was described as a “quiet” and “beautiful neighborhood.”

According to Jackson Police Chief Joseph Wade, around 4 p.m. in the Brookhollow Subdivision, two groups of men, believed to be teenagers, were involved in a shootout involving assault rifles and handguns.

One 18-year-old was arrested and charged with one count of shooting into an occupied dwelling.

He is expected to face more charges.

Four others are wanted.

Over one hundred shells were recovered, according to Chief Wade. Two guns, as well as a Jeep, were also recovered.

While multiple vehicles and houses in the subdivision were damaged, “due to the grace of God,” Wade said, no injuries were reported.
